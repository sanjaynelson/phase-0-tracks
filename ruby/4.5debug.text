I can improve workflow especially in reading/test code, and continually improving my git workflow. I’ve been working at intentionally commiting frequently as reccomended, but I still forget about aspects of git workflow on occaision and really need to root out those issues - even creating the .txt file I wrote this on on the master branch! 
As far as ruby-specific stuff, testing code with irb is something I’m definitely slacking in, and I’ve often leaned a bit more towards FYWG than intentionally testing one theory at a time, with proper git workflow. These are definite areas I should improve.
