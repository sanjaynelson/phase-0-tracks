# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control maintains past & present history of projects and developers use it to easily solve issues through reverting to past versions of projects.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are duplicates of a repo. You may use one to work on an idividual feature, modifying it instead of the original, master branch of the repo. This allows focused work on a specific feature and is a safety net from potential mistakes made to the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit adds a new version the repo to access through git. Commit's feature messages to detail what is changed in said commit, therefore, the message should be an accurate description of the change/add/removals made.
* What is a merge conflict?
When two branches are merged and feature conflicting changes in code/etc. which cannot exist simultaneously.

new answers:

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* 
* It's like a librarian of all the different versions/edits of a file, which keeps history and allows you to revert when needed. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* Branchs, or feature branches, are used to work on specific aspects of a repository to allow multiple developers to work in the same repository without conflicts. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit saves a version (locally), as mentioned earlier. A good message for a commit is brief but desciptive of what is being commited, with what info. 
* What is a merge conflict?
* When two different branches are attempted to be merged with competing info.
