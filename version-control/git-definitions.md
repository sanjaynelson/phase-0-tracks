# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* It's like a librarian of all the different versions/edits of a file, which keeps history and allows you to revert when needed. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* Branchs, or feature branches, are used to work on specific aspects of a repository to allow multiple developers to work in the same repository without conflicts. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit saves a version (locally), as mentioned earlier. A good message for a commit is brief but desciptive of what is being commited, with what info. 
* What is a merge conflict?
* When two different branches are attempted to be merged with competing info.
